# Kindness Chain - Brief Project Description

**Goal**: Create a global chain of kindness through AI-powered phone calls.

**How it works**:
1. AI calls random phone numbers worldwide
2. Plays a kind message recorded by a previous human caller
3. Asks if they want to record their own kind message for the next person
4. If yes, person records a 30-60 second positive message
5. AI validates the message content for appropriateness
6. System calls the next random person and plays this new recording
7. Later, AI calls back participants to share how their message impacted others

**Core Experience**: Real human voices spreading authentic kindness globally, one call at a time.

**Tech Stack**: Vapi AI + Twilio for calls, human voice recordings (not AI synthesis), content moderation via speech-to-text + OpenAI.
