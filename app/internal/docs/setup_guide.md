# 🎯 Kindness Chain Setup Guide

## ✅ Current Status
Your API is working correctly! The structure is perfect. You just need to add your actual credentials.

## 🔧 Required Setup Steps

### 1. Get Your VAPI Private Token
1. Go to [VAPI Dashboard](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/)
2. Navigate to API Keys section
3. Copy your Private API Key

### 2. Get Your Twilio Credentials
1. Go to [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com/)
2. Get your **Account SID** from the dashboard
3. Make sure your phone number `+1 (628) 250-2830` is active in your Twilio account

### 3. Update Your .env File
Replace the placeholder values in your `.env` file:

```bash
VAPI_PRIVATE_TOKEN=your_actual_vapi_token_here
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+16282502830
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_actual_twilio_account_sid_here
```

### 4. VAPI-Twilio Integration
Make sure in your VAPI dashboard:
- Twilio integration is enabled
- Your Twilio credentials are connected
- The phone number `+16282502830` is verified and active

## 🧪 Test Your Setup

Once you've added the real credentials, test with:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/make_outbound_call" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"phone_number": "+17247327261"}'
```

Expected success response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Call initiated successfully",
  "call_id": "some-uuid",
  "status": "queued"
}
```

## 📱 What Happens Next

When the call is successful:
1. Your phone (+17247327261) will ring
2. You'll hear: "Hi! We are here to spread love, not hate. Do you want to leave a message for the next caller?"
3. If you say yes, you can record a 30-60 second positive message
4. The AI will thank you and end the call

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

- **"VAPI_PRIVATE_TOKEN not configured"**: Add your real VAPI token
- **"TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID not configured"**: Add your real Twilio Account SID
- **"Number Not Found on Twilio"**: Verify the phone number in your Twilio console
- **Authentication errors**: Check your VAPI dashboard for Twilio integration status

Your code is perfect - just need the real credentials! 🚀
